# Enable your first integrations

Your Leanly account is only as powerful as the integrations you enable. By connecting your account with external tools, services, or applications, you can:

- Bootstrap new application source code in your preferred Source Code Management solution (e.g. Github)

- Deploy a cloud landing zone with your cloud provider of choice (e.g. AWS)

- Self-serve CI/CD processes by the click of a button (e.g. GitLab Pipelines)

- Streamline observability instrumentation, from simple out-of-the-box monitoring solutions (e.g. AWS CloudWatch) to advanced observability suites (e.g. Dynatrace)

... and much more.

## Integrations

For a full list of available integrations head over to our [integration docs](../guides/integrations).

## Example Use Case

In this getting started guide, we'll walk through deploying a simple static website. Before deploying the actual application, we need to set up one essential integration: your **Git provider** of choice. Connecting Leanly with your Git provider enables us to bootstrap application source code on your behalf, respond to special commit messages, create pull requests to propose fixes or mitigations, and much more.

This guide will cover a GitHub integration only. Later, youâ€™ll be free to choose any supported providers that suit your needs.

### GitHub Integration

Please refer to our [GitHub integration guide](../guides/integrations/github) and return once your GitHub integration is successfully set up and ready for use in your Leanly tenant. (<a href="../guides/integrations/github" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>)
