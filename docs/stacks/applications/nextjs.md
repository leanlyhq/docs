## Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications with ease. It provides an excellent developer experience with features like:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generate static pages at build time for optimal loading speeds
- **API Routes:** Create backend API endpoints within your Next.js application
- **File-based Routing:** Automatic routing based on your file structure
- **Built-in CSS Support:** Native support for CSS modules, Sass, and styled-components
- **TypeScript Support:** First-class TypeScript integration for better type safety
- **Hot Reloading:** Instant feedback during development with fast refresh
- **Optimized Images:** Automatic image optimization with the Next.js Image component
- **Internationalization:** Built-in support for multiple languages and locales
